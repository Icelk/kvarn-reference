# Kvarn reference binary

This is a reference implementation of the Kvarn server library.
It's for my personal use for my domains [icelk.dev](https://icelk.dev/) and [kvarn.org](https://kvarn.org/)
and will therefore not work with most configurations.

For now, I suggest forking this repo and tweaking it to your liking.

# Future

I plan to add support for a config file so you do *not* have to recompile the binary every time you want to support a new domain.
