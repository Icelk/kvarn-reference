# Kvarn reference binary

This is a reference implementation of the Kvarn server library.
It's for my personal use for my domains (icelk.dev)[https://icelk.dev/] and (kvarn.org)[https://kvarn.org/]
and will therefore not work with most configurations.

For now, i suggest forking this repo and changing the appropriate values.


# Future

I plan to add support for a config file so you do *not* have to recomplie the binary every time you want to support a new domain.
Though, focus for now lies on **Kvarn v0.2.0**
